[Nuclear Science](https://modrinth.com/mod/nuclear-science),
with a more improved vanilla minecraft. Modpack technical by Lyriclia**

# ✨Vanilla
**In the pack I improved vanilla minecraft by adding new features, it has many mods that improve vanilla and add variety, and new content**

# ⚡Performance
**With each update of the modpack I try to improve performance so that the FPS does not drop and it is comfortable to play. Now this is considered a serious problem for me, since I am not strong in optimization**

# 🏭Industrial
**It has many technical mods. For example, Meкаnism, Electrodynamics and others. And also addons that diversify technical mods. And much more. As they say, "The Factory Must Grow!"**
