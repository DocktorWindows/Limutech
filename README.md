# 🤔Modpack
**A modpack for playing with friends, combining such mods as Create, Mekanism, Computer Craft, Electrodynamics, Immersive Engineering and Nuclear Science with a more improved vanilla minecraft. Modpack technical by Lyriclia**

# ✨Vanilla
**In the pack I improved vanilla minecraft by adding new features, it has many mods that improve vanilla and add variety, as well as new content. You can explore the world, or do industry or many other things**

# 🏭Industrial
**It has many technical mods. For example, Meкаnism, Electrodynamics and others. And also addons that diversify technical mods. And much more. As they say, "The Factory Must Grow!"**

# ⚡Performance
**With each update of the modpack I try to improve performance so that the FPS does not drop and it is comfortable to play. Now this is considered a serious problem for me, since I am not strong in optimization**

# 🏞️Generation
**Terralitch and Tectonic are involved in generation, and other mods that add new biomes**

# 🌋Nether Generation
**Generation is handled by Incendium, which greatly changes hell and makes it more diverse and interesting**

# ☁️End generation
**The End generation is handled by Nullsape, he changes the generation and adds new biomes to diversify the end not like in vanilla Minecraft (Where is the END Mojang update?)**

# 🏡Structures
**There are many mods in the modpack for the variety of structures in the game, There are Dungeons and Taverns, and all mods like Yung's**
